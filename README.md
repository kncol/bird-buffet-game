Welcome to "Bird Buffet"! In this game, your goal is to get a high score by collecting worms (worth one point) and frogs (worth two) before the time runs out after 40 seconds. Utilize the randomly generated puddles around the map in order to get to the prey and avoid the cat on a skateboard.
You are also able to customize your bird by clicking the 'C' key on the main menu screen. Press the correlating number for the bird you wish to play as and then go back to the main menu when you have made your choice!
